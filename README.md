# Unity-Advanced-Weapon-System
Feature-rich weapon system for Unity, including Raycast shooting, ammo management, and integrated audio/UI feedback.
A professional-grade weapon system framework designed for FPS/TPS projects in Unity.

## Key Features

I developed a functional weapon system in Unity. It features precise shooting mechanics using both Raycasts and physical projectiles also implemented an ammo management system with smooth reloading and integrated visual/audio feedback like recoil and particles for a better feel.

- UI-Ready: It’s already set up to work with TextMeshPro. You just drag your text object, and it shows your current ammo and total bullets.

## Technical Notes
This system uses **Unity's New Input System** and is optimized for modularity, allowing it to be easily swapped between different weapon types.
